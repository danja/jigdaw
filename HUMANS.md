# What needs a person

Actions only you can take. Everything else is in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) and
[TODO.md](TODO.md).

Ordered by what blocks most.

## 1. Pull on strandz.it

`plugins/ferrite/` is not live: `https://strandz.it/jigdaw/plugins/ferrite/` still 404s, while
`plugins/boost/` (committed earlier the same day) already answers 200. Everything since
Boost was last pulled, including Ferrite, the JUCE-hosted adapter, the local-agent panel and
`docs/for-juce-developers.md`, is sitting on `main` and not yet on the server.

Nothing in that range touched `bin/serve.js`, so no restart, just the pull:

```sh
cd /home/github/jigdaw && git pull
```

See [Updating a deployment](#updating-a-deployment) below for the general form and what to
check afterward.

## 2. Tools that would help

**lld, for the WebAssembly build of `plugins/8b8/` and `plugins/boost/`.** Ubuntu's `clang`
package ships no `wasm-ld`, so both plugins' `build.sh` link through the `rust-lld` that
rustup already installed for the Rust plugins, found by searching `~/.rustup` and symlinked
under the name the clang driver looks for. It is the same linker and it produces a working
module, but the fallback depends on a rust toolchain being present for a build that otherwise
has nothing to do with rust, and on rustup's internal layout.

```sh
sudo apt install lld-18
```

Both `build.sh` scripts use `wasm-ld` directly when it is on the path and say nothing more
about it.

## Updating a deployment

**[docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md) opens with this**, including which changes need the
restart and what to curl afterwards. The short form:

```sh
npm run build && npm test          # on your machine, then commit and push
cd /home/github/jigdaw && git pull
sudo systemctl restart jigdaw      # only when bin/serve.js changed
```

A pull moves the page, the bundle, the profiles and the WebAssembly immediately, because they
are read from disk per request. `bin/serve.js` is loaded once at startup, so a change inside
it is invisible until the restart, and the symptom is a new page talking to an old server.

Measured 2026-09-23. Re-check before acting; all of it drifts.
